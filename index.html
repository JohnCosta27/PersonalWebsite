      <p class="AboutMeText">
        I am a student currently in Year 13, studying Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science and Music,
        and in the future will be studying BSci Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)Â  at Royal Holloway University.
        I have always been passionate about programming, even from early on. I also play guitar and have done so for about 4 years now,
        capable of playing to a grade 7 standard. I work part-time as a tutor which I love doing.

      <p class="AboutMeText">
        I have worked on many personal projects in the past and also done a big project
        for my coursework for A-level Computer Science. I have extensive experience with web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc...).
        I also work with Node.js to create my servers, together with SQLite to interact with databases. I also have experience with Java, including
        various Java libraries such as Jetty and Spigot (Minecraft plugins).
